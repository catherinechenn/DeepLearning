# Deep learning projects

## Overview 

This repository contains some of projects I achieved  in order to learn about neural networks. It focus on deep-learning, using different types of neural networks and approaches .

## Project 1:

The project 1 focus on building a Neural Network to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. Imagine yourself owning a bikesharing company. You want to predict how many bycles you need beacuse if they are too few, you will loose money from potential rides, if they are too many, you will wating money on buying cycles just settled around.  You need to predict from historical datas how money bycles you will need to buy in the future.

### Dependencies

* Download anaconda
* Create a new conda environment:
```
conda create --name bikesharing python=3
```
* Activate the source
```
source activate bikesharing
```
* Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
```
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
```
* Run the following to open up the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook bikesharing-neural-network.ipynb
```
